      I'm glad to see you here. This website is designed to present all of
      Yulia's projects, knowledge, and some fun personal touches. On the home
      page, you can find my resumes, social links, and even send me a direct
      email. Please check the Portfolio page to see my most recent projects,
      skills and most importantly don't forget to leave a review. Visit my shop
      to find my top picked products, and browse the Blog to catch up and get to
      know me better. This website was created with Django, REST-API, and
      Angular. The back-end uses APIs to communicate with the server, while the
      front-end has been developed with the help of Bootstrap and other custom
      designs.
